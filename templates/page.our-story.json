            "description": "<p>In 1982, Ina threw caution to the wind, leaving behind the security of her lecturing post to start a cookery school in the family’s converted garage. The business got off to a slow start as people were unaccustomed to paying to learn how to cook, and she did not have a budget for advertising. So, her teenage sons were dispatched on their bicycles through the neighbourhood to drop homemade flyers into people’s post boxes. But, seven years later, the school became hugely popular as a result of the life breathed into it by Ina’s infectious love for cooking and teaching.</p><p>At the same time, Ina’s youngest son, Graham, who had recently finished a business degree and was about to write his final chartered accountancy exam, announced, to the horror of his parents, that it was not the career he wanted for himself. She recalls Graham nonchalantly remarking: “Let’s go into business together. You can cook, and I can count. So, what is the problem?”</p><p>And so, a very special entrepreneurial relationship between mother and son came into being, which has served as the foundational strength of the business ever since.</p><p>From those early days in a garage almost a generation ago, this small, but highly respected cookery school morphed into a fledgling food-manufacturing business in 1990.</p><p>Never the risk taker, the late Ted Paarman made the uncharacteristically bold, but brave decision to aid his determined wife and youthfully idealistic, ambitious son in their start-up venture. He invested his hard-earned retirement savings, which, along with the income from Ina’s first self-published cookbook, <em>Cook with Ina Paarman</em>, sowed the seeds for what would grow into the now legendary Paarman Foods. </p><p>In the years since, the business has become a household name with an enviable international reputation for putting quality and flavour first. It now exports Ina Paarman’ Spices, Seasonings, Sauces, and more to 32 countries worldwide.</p>",

            "bquote": "“Although the idea is an ostensibly simple one, the concept of producing food on a large scale in a factory that does not taste like it is mass-produced is the goal which all of our staff have willingly and enthusiastically embraced with a certain missionary zeal.” – Graham Paarman.",
            "description": "<p>Essentially, this means recreating all the goodness and wholesomeness of premium-quality, home-style cooking in our high-tech food processing facility. </p><p>Considering that time is undeniably the most precious resource today, customers demand convenience – but not at the expense of taste, flavour, and health. Having always recognised this, Paarman Foods constantly strives to make food products in the time-honoured, traditional way, using fresh, seasonal ingredients that will deliver a full-flavoured, authentic taste experience.</p><p>The Ina Paarman story is one of enthusiastically embracing the pursuit of flavour by unquestionably going the extra mile and doing the “difficult stuff well” every day. This includes slow-roasting vegetables in wood-burning ovens, the unavoidably time-consuming process of producing traditional bone stocks to extract maximum flavour and nutrition, and more.</p><p>Today, over three decades later, the Paarmans sometimes feel as if their journey has only just begun. They are consumed, more so than ever, with realising their dream of enriching people’s lives by enhancing their joy of cooking and eating – whether they are kitchen novices, enthusiastic home cooks or experienced chefs.</p><p>The entire extended Paarman Foods team are immensely proud of what they do daily and remains dedicated to providing their loyal customers with trusted products they will love and enjoy.</p>",
